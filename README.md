# TodoList

This is a Todo List app. 

I built both the front-end and the back-end of this app.

The front-end app is built using React, and the back-end server is Node.

I used Mongodb as database and mongoose to connect Mongodb and Node.

## Features Include:
- Session-management allows users to remember their logged in accounts
- Create a new account and log in
- Check a to-do item
- Delete a checked to-do item
- Uncheck a to-do item

## Technologies Used:
React, Node, Express.js, Mongodb, moogoose(npm package), bcrypt(npm package), express-session(npm package)
